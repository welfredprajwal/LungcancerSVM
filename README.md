🫁 Lung Cancer Detection using SVM

📌 Overview

This project applies Machine Learning (Support Vector Machine - SVM) to detect lung cancer based on patient medical data and imaging features. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve survival rates.

The model uses data preprocessing, feature selection, and SVM classification to identify whether a patient is likely to have lung cancer.
🎯 Objectives

Preprocess patient and medical imaging data.

Apply SVM classifier to detect lung cancer.

Evaluate model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Provide a baseline approach for AI-assisted medical diagnosis.
